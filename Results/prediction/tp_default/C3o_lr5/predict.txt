 Please explain how you got the result. SELECT email_address FROM Professionals WHERE state  =  "Hawaii" OR state  =  "Wisconsin";
 We can use JOIN query SELECT email_address FROM professionals WHERE state  =  "Hawaii" OR state  =  "Wisconsin"
 So using the information from the selected table and given conditions,  we need to write select query without any aggregate functions.

 Thanks for using the SQLizer! For HOW MANY DOGS HAVE AN AGE BELOW THE AVERAGE?, the query is SELECT count(*) FROM Dogs WHERE age  <  (SELECT avg(age) FROM Dogs)
 SELECT count(*) FROM dogs WHERE age  <  (SELECT avg(age) FROM dogs)
 SELECT max(cost_of_treatment) FROM treatments
 SELECT Cost_of_Treatment FROM Treatments ORDER BY Date_of_Treatment DESC LIMIT 1
 Thanks for using the DBSchemaExecutor! Here is your SQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM dogs WHERE dog_id NOT IN (SELECT dog_id FROM Treatments)
 SELECT count(*) FROM dogs WHERE dog_id NOT IN (SELECT dog_id FROM treatments)
 So using the information from the selected table and given conditions,  How many owners temporarily do not have any dogs?
SELECT count(*) FROM owners WHERE owner_id NOT IN (SELECT owner_id FROM dogs)
 Thanks for using the DB Schema Validator! Here is the query SELECT count(*) FROM Professionals WHERE professional_id NOT IN (SELECT Professional_ID FROM Treatments)
 Please explain how you got the result.SELECT count(*) FROM professionals WHERE professional_id NOT IN ( SELECT professional_id FROM treatments );
